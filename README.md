# Machine learning - PCA of UsArrests dataset  
In this task, we explore the arrests based on different types of crimes in various cities using unsupervised learning methods such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and
various clustering techniques. The dataset we will be exploring contains data on 50
states. There are 4 variables for each city in total, with 4 describing the crime incidents in each state.

## About
This dataset is from the US Arrests Kaggle challenge (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kurohana/usarrets). A description of the data is given as: “This data set contains statistics, in arrests per 100,000 residents, for assault, murder, and rape in each of the 50 US states in 1973. Also given is the percent of the population living in urban areas.”

## Getting Started
To run this project, install library:
#Import libraries
